> This app was created through "vibe coding," i.e., instructing an AI agent (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) what to build. I didn't touch the code. I dunno... the future is uncertain and mildly concerning. But also it's cool to be able to describe an app that is, essentially, just a CRUD interface, and to just have 'someone' else code it for me. I've thought a lot about how inefficient programming can be; I compare it to creating a new car and building (like, literally sketching out and creating from scratch) an engine each time. At some point, we as programmers need a common toolbox, right? I mean, how many times do we have to write a DB middle layer that's essentially exactly the same each time, except with a couple different buisness logics or fields.
